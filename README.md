Yes, absolutely. Many couples visit Ayuh Fertility Centre after 1 or 2 failed IVF attempts elsewhere. Dr. Krupa Shah carefully reviews past reports â€” like embryo grading, medication protocols, and ultrasound notes.

They may also run missing tests like sperm DNA fragmentation, endometrial thickness, or thyroid panels to get a clearer picture.

Couples say they feel calmer after visiting Ayuh â€” because everything is re-checked gently and honestly.
